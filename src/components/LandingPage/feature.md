   Expense Summary: Have an automated summary that shows how much they've spent, saved, or are over budget each month.

2. Smart Notifications & Reminders
   Expense Reminders: In addition to the monthly carry-forward feature, you could send users reminders for bill payments, recurring expenses, or even warnings when they are approaching a budget limit.
   Goal Setting Alerts: If users set financial goals (e.g., saving $1000 in 6 months), provide regular progress updates and offer motivation to stay on track.
   Team Collaboration Alerts: Notify users when a team member adds or updates an expense.

3. Expense Categories & Tags
   Custom Categories: Allow users to create and categorize their expenses beyond pre-defined ones. For example, "Vacation," "Emergency Funds," or "Home Renovation."
   Tagging System: Users can tag expenses (e.g., "Work," "Family," "Health") for easy sorting and filtering, making it easier to generate reports.
   Shared Categories: In team settings, team leaders can create categories for shared team expenses (e.g., office supplies, project costs), which the team members can add to.

4. AI Features & Automation
   AI Bill Scanning: Expanding on the AI feature that reads and adds expenses from receipts, you could also allow users to upload PDF invoices or photos of physical receipts for AI processing.
   Auto-Expense Prediction: Use AI to predict upcoming expenses based on historical data (e.g., utilities, subscriptions). If there's a recurring pattern, the system can suggest or automatically add these expenses.
   Expense Optimization: AI could also suggest ways to cut down on recurring expenses or provide budgeting tips based on user data.
5. Team Collaboration & Access Control
   Permission Levels: Expand the team collaboration feature by allowing users to set more granular permissions (view-only, edit, approve expenses, etc.).
   Expense Approval Workflow: Allow for an approval system where expenses added by team members must be approved by a manager or admin before being added to the budget.
   Team Expense Reports: Generate reports for teams to see their collective spending, along with individual contributions. Team leaders could have access to aggregated data, while team members only see their own expenses.
6. Expense Insights and Reports
   Detailed Reports: Users can generate detailed financial reports based on categories, time periods (daily, weekly, monthly), or team members.
   Projected Expenses: Offer a "Projected Expenses" feature that estimates the total costs for the coming month based on current trends.
   Balance Sheet Generation for Projects/Events: Integrating balance sheet generation after events is great! Expand it by allowing users to set up different income/expense categories related to specific projects, ensuring more detailed financial tracking.
7. Integrations and Data Import
   Bank/Payment Gateway Integration: Allow users to link their bank accounts, credit cards, or payment apps (e.g., PayPal) so that expenses are automatically imported, categorized, and tracked in real-time.
   Third-Party App Integration: Integrate with popular apps like Google Calendar (for bill due dates), Dropbox (for storing receipts), or even accounting software like QuickBooks for seamless synchronization.
8. Expense Sharing & Split Payments
   Shared Expenses: Add the option for users to share certain expenses (e.g., group dinners, travel costs) with family or colleagues and split them easily.
   Expense Splitter: If an expense needs to be split among multiple people, offer a built-in tool that automatically divides the amount by the number of people involved.
   Reimbursement Tracking: For team collaborations, allow users to track reimbursements and ensure everyone is paid back fairly.
9. Gamification and Incentives
   Spending Challenges: Add gamification to encourage saving and smart spending. For example, users could challenge themselves to cut down on a specific category for the month or save a set amount.
   Reward System: Introduce a reward system where users earn points or badges for meeting savings goals or staying under budget.
10. Security & Data Privacy
    End-to-End Encryption: Ensure that usersâ€™ financial data is securely stored and encrypted to protect their privacy.

    Voice Input: Integrate voice commands to add expenses or search through transactions quickly using voice assistants (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant).
    Dark Mode: Many users prefer dark mode for easier reading at night. Include this option for a better user experience.
